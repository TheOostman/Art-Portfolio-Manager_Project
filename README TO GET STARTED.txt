HOW AND WHERE TO EDIT

go to:
    - src>main>java>com.example.gpass

MainApplication = basic UI
MainController = the java commands behind each button's actions

go to:
    - src>main>java>resources>con.example...>

mainWindowControls = The UI of the MainApplication. This is where you add buttons etc.

NOTE:
If you need to add another page or anything then feel free to change or create more pathways or anything.
I did start the basic UI (including the UI for Login/Register)

Things to DO:
1. Login / Register of users - ?
2. Enable users to upload and delete content (Photos) - ?
3. Enable profiles to access the user's information (photos included) - Ethan (Need register and upload to be finished first however)
4. Design how they are to be placed - Ethan
